# My "Udemy's iOS 13 and Swift 5 Complete bootcamp" learning progress

This is the repository which contains my progress while learning every chapter from Udemy's course.

Currently I have completed following chapters:
* Chapter 2: Building "I am Rich" application
* Chapter 3: Something like homework: build "I am Poor" application similar to "I am Rich" app
* Chapter 4: Useful resources
  * 21 Open Source iOS Apps Written in Swift - https://medium.mybridge.co/21-amazing-open-source-ios-apps-written-in-swift-5e835afee98e
  * Open Source iOS apps in GitHub - https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps
  * What I learned: some introduction to variables, simple data types, method invocations and UI/Code interactions by creating Dice roller app. Since I already have some background knowledge about variables and data types from Java -- I had to watch them quickly just to make some comparisons between 2 languages.
* Chapter 5: Finished creating simple app Magic 8 Ball
* Chapter 6: Completed the task related to Calculator autolayout.
* Chapter 7: Finished the chapter by completing Xylophone functionality.
