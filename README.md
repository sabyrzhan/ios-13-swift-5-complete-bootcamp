This is the repository which contains my progress while learning every chapter from Udemy's course.

Currently I have completed following chapters:

  * Open Source iOS apps in GitHub - https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps
  * What I learned: some introduction to variables, simple data types, method invocations and UI/Code interactions by creating Dice roller app. Since I already have some background knowledge about variables and data types from Java -- I had to watch them quickly just to make some comparisons between 2 languages.
* Chapter 5: Finished creating simple app Magic 8 Ball
* Chapter 6: Completed the task related to Calculator autolayout.
* Chapter 7: Finished the chapter by completing Xylophone functionality.
  * https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch -- About Dispatch or GCD -- let's to add concurrency functionality to your program
* Chapter 8: Finished the chapter. Learned that we can use Timer class to enable countdown/countup timer in your app with 1 second delay
* Chapter 9: learned about struct in Swift, progress bar view, how to create custom buttons using background, structs and some did some MVC stuff
* Chapter 10: Finished. Some practice project. Nothing challenging. Just to sum up what learned.
* Chapter 11: Finished it. Learned the diff between Struct vs Class, working with segues and additional VCs.
* Chapter 12: Finished chapter by working on excercise project. Nothing new to learn.
* Chapter 13: Learned about protocol/extensions and delegates, location management
* Chapter 14: Practice project: fetch bitcoin rates for selected currency. Use knowledge about network, REST API usage, extensions and protocols.
* Chapter 15: Learned about UITableViewController and working with Firebase, managing keyboard autohide and autopopup using IQKeyboardManager.
* Chapter 17: Learned about SwiftUI, observable pattern, adding logics into ContentView, running iOS application on Mac by enabling Catalyst.
* Chapter 18:
   - Learned about UserDefaults
   - FileManager to persist user data
   - CRUD data and adding predicates to query using CoreData, SeachBar.
   - Add RealmSwift pod to use instead of CoreData
   - Migrated from CoreData to RealmSwift
   - Integrated SwipeTableViewCell and used inheritence
   - Imporeved design using Chameleon library
* Chapter 19: Didnt pass it. Need Apple Developer Account.
* Chapter 21: Created "Hotdog or Not hotdog" app with CoreML
* Chapter 23: Created "WhatFlower" app with CoreML and Caffe pretrained model
* Chapter 24: Built own ML model to detect VW cars
* Chapter 25: Built NLP processing app using Twitter data
* Chapter 26: Generating 3D objects and horizontal planes using ARKit.
* BONUS: The complete app design course. Overall, the design is made in following order:
  1. User flow dragram - drown using pencil or online tool to quickly draw forms. Can use https://miro.com/
  2. Prototype/Wireframe - draw using more like app design, but still with mock elements. Can use https://marvelapp.com/ or https://www.canva.com/ or https://proto.io/
  3. Mockup - actual design of the app for specific platform (iOS or Android). Can use Sketch app, Principle for Mac.
